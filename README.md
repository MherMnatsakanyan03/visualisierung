# Visualisierung

## Chapter 1

$size\_of\_effect = \frac{difference}{first\_value}$

$lie\_factor = \frac{size\_of\_effect\_graph}{size\_of\_effect\_data}$

`Change blindness`: significant changes are not noticed by the observer

goals: visual exploration, analysis and presentation

**pipeline**: `data acquisition` -> `filtering` -> `visualization/mapping` -> `rendering/interaction`

## Chapter 2

`Sensory memory`: Preattentive processing, "instinctive" perception

`Short-term memory`: seconds to minutes, limited capacity

`Long-term memory`: days to years, unlimited capacity

`Weber's law`: linear increase in subjective perception with logarithmic increase in stimulus intensity

Distinguish 200 colors (H), 500 gradations (S), 20 variation (V)

Two stages of visual perception:

1. `Preattentive`: automatic, parallel processing of visual features
2. `Attentive`: serial processing, requires focus

Preatentive attributes: < 8 hues, <= 4 orientations, <= 4 sizes, <= 10 else

non-preatentive attributes: parallelism, juncture

Color: use high luminance contrast, avoid red-green combinations, only use max 5 colors

## Chapter 3

Best to worst mapping: `position` -> `length` -> `angle/slope` -> `area` -> `luminance/saturation` -> `volume/curvature`

Steven's area judgment scale: $I = \alpha r^{1.4}$

Rule: map most important data to the most accurate visual attribute

`Simple line Graphs`: direct comparison, fine details **BUT** clutter, hard to distinguish time series

`Stacked Graphs`: time series destinguish **BUT** less vertivcal resolution, hard to compare time series

`Small multiples`: easy time series destinguish, easy to compare **BUT** less resolution per time, difficult to compare across time

`Horiton Graphs`: vertical resolution, quick min/max **BUT** steep learning curve, hard to compare

Quartils: $Q_1 = (n+1)/4$, $Q_2 = (n+1)/2$, $Q_3 = 3(n+1)/4$

Parallel Coordinates: crossing lines -> negative correlation, parallel lines -> positive correlation
